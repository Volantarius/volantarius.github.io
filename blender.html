		<h3>Half-Life: Alyx Complex from GoldenEye</h3>
		<p>Using Blender, I recreated my favourite level from GoldenEye for Half-Life Alyx. I quit the project when I later found out the scale was all wrong, and the editor doesn't have a proper way of scaling the geometry and UVs. My computer was also struggling to run the game itself.</p>

		<p>Blender has a nice way of exporting normal maps of geometry correctly. Usually artists will use a heightmap or something drawn and then process it through a program using various technics that don't create a realistic result.Using the same geometry I also exported Ambient Occlusion maps, Roughness, etc.</p>
		<pre class="codewrapper">TODO: Add the textures here and Blender shots.</pre>
		<p>Because my computer struggled to run the game, I had only built the level in desktop mode. Once I finished most of the level, I tried it in VR to only realize the walls looked more flat than I thought!</p>
