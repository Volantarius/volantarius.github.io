# Portfolio

Hello! This is a highlight of the various projects and interests I have over the years.

# Hammer

I have used Source's Hammer Editor since 2007 to around 2017. Self taught and always been open to criticism and self improving. Most of my finished work are recreations of maps from other games.

## 2013

This is a recreation of a map called Hometown. I was trying out other lighting methods and created a cloudy skybox.
